  copy: `I’m Vishnu Vivek Valeti, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida with a passion for building software that is scalable, performant, and accessible. My work spans front-end and full-stack development, where I enjoy crafting clean React/Next.js interfaces, reusable UI components, and data-driven dashboards. I also have hands-on experience with backend systems in Go, Python, and Java, along with SQL/NoSQL databases, cloud platforms like AWS, and containerized deployments using Docker.

Professionally, I’ve contributed as a Graduate Research Assistant at UF, where I developed interactive dashboards and machine learning pipelines to evaluate fairness in AI models. I also built production-ready portals and dashboards at Vignan University, helping streamline workflows and improve accessibility for hundreds of users. These experiences have taught me how to balance technical depth with user-centered design.

Outside of academics, I love working on personal projects that challenge me to explore new technologies and solve real problems. Some of these include JobScoop, a job search platform with full-stack integration, and a Reddit-style discussion forum built in Go. At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the joy of turning ideas into reliable, impactful applications.`,
