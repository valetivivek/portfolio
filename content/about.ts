  copy: `I'm Vishnu Vivek Valeti, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida with a passion for building software that is scalable, performant, and accessible. My work spans full-stack development and machine learning, where I enjoy crafting clean React interfaces, robust Go backends, and production-ready ML systems.

Currently, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at ReplyQuick LLC, where I train and fine-tune supervised ML models in Python, build cloud-based training pipelines on AWS, and integrate model outputs into production workflows. Previously, I developed a React-based accreditation platform at UF that automated evaluation workflows for 10+ operators, reducing manual review effort by 50%. I enjoy shipping measurable outcomes, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and improving systems with a calm, methodical approach.`,
