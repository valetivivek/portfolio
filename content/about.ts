  copy: `I’m Vishnu Vivek Valeti, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, specializing in building scalable, performant, and accessible software systems.

My focus lies in front-end and full-stack development, where I craft clean React/Next.js interfaces, reusable UI components, and data-driven dashboards. I also work on backend systems in Go, Python, and Java, with experience across SQL/NoSQL databases, cloud services (AWS), and containerized deployments (Docker).

Professionally, I’ve contributed as a Graduate Research Assistant at UF, where I built interactive dashboards and ML pipelines to evaluate fairness in AI models. I’ve also delivered production-ready portals and dashboards at Vignan University, improving workflows and accessibility for hundreds of users.

Beyond academics, I love working on personal projects like JobScoop, a job search platform with full-stack integration, and a Reddit-style discussion forum in Go. I’m motivated by solving complex problems, designing inclusive UIs, and turning ideas into reliable, impactful applications.`,
