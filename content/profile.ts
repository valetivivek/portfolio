  summary:
    "Front-end developer passionate about building fast, accessible, and maintainable interfaces. I focus on performant React/Next.js apps, scalable component systems with TypeScript, and smooth developer experience. I care deeply about clean abstractions, testable code, and shipping UIs that feel effortless. Recent work includes crafting reusable UI primitives, improving Lighthouse scores, and collaborating with product and design to iterate quickly. I enjoy working across the stack where needed, but Iâ€™m happiest polishing the details that make interfaces delightful and inclusive.",
